								<p>Hi, my name is Tia Comyns, my student number is s3797021 and my email is s3797021@student.rmit.edu.au </p>
								<p>A bit of background on me, I was born November 1997 in Hong Kong and I've lived in Australia now for a little over 16 years, I moved from Sydney to Melbourne 10 months ago and i'm really loving the city. 
I graduated from Cronulla High School in 2015 and took a few years between school and Uni to discover myself, do some working and some travelling and find out what I really wanted to do with my life. 
In my free time I enjoy playing video games, consuming sci-fi media in all its forms and I also have a very cool pokémon card collection that i'm pretty proud of.</p>

							<article id="iloveit">
								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My fascination with IT stemmed from my childhood, I was so interested in knowing how things worked that I would often take toys apart and try and reconstruct them, this developed in my teens into a passion for building PC's, I find assembling a computer very therapeutic. Something that was slightly less accessible but I was still quite curious about, was the software that goes into the computer, the brains behind the physical pieces of the computer that made everything work, I always understood the basic functionality and why but the code is what I find really fascinating. 
<p/>
<p>I chose to come to RMIT because a friend of mine recently graduated from RMIT and I've heard from many that the IT course here is one of the best, as well as knowing that RMIT has so many industry connections through former students and affiliated organisations. Its also a very unique university in the sense that it doesn't feel like </p>
								<p>During my Studies I hope to learn the ins and outs of IT. From the barebone construction of a website or piece of software to designing a user friendly interface and performing maintenance. I enjoy a challenge and I think that learning Programming is a great way to challenge myself every day and in the workplace. </p>

							<article id="mydreamjob">
								<h2 class="major">My Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> The <a href=https://www.seek.com.au/job/38495425?type=standard&searchrequesttoken=8cd7ff84-369e-4625-8d1e-f5e605dbd42b> Job Ad</a> I chose is as a Fullstack Java Developer for DotDev posted by affix group. I've posted a screenshot of the gist of the job ad below. But its basically an opportunity to create Web Applications, Apps and even do some API Development which is something I find really interesting to implement and try out for myself. The successful applicant (hopefully me) would work with a close and talented team to create these pieces of software in the realm of Shopify products. You're also expected to update and improve on the software over time and implement new ideas and strategies of your own design, with focus on the products they provide rather than the ecommerce side of things. The role also includes the opportunity to work with big companies on their web platforms, with names like Bank of Melbourne and Shopify in their portfolio.</p>
								<p> The thing that most appeals to me about the role is the close knit team based environment they portray in the job ad, even just the written advertisement gives me a great feeling about the working environment, which is arguably one of the most important things about any job you will ever have.
									The role also allows for quite a lot of creativity and problem solving, both things that are very appealing to me as I love being creative and experimenting.
									The company also is located in South Yarra which is a huge plus for me as I hate driving ages to get to work and live close by, and also has a degree of flexibility with the working hours, which is something else thats pretty important to me as my life can get a bit hectic at times. The only other notable plus is they offer competitive salary packages with bonus and entitlements, whilst this is not outlined in detail in the advertisement its something I would be pretty excited for if I was actually applying for this role right now
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/jobad.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> The role requires lots of teamwork, strong Javascript skills, and preferably experience in areas like Serverless Architechure, Node.js and React.js, and amazing problem solving ability, there is also quite a bit of creative freedom in this role so the ability to be creative and identify what the client needs is essential. </p>
								<p> The position requires a lot more Java skill than I currently have, it also requires experience in programs I've only ever heard of and never even put into practice like Serverless Architechure etc. However, I definitely have the experience in working with a team, with almost 7 years experience working and managing staff in team environments. I am also a very creative person and I love problem solving which are definitely big parts of this role however, I don't believe my ability in either of these are currently up to the level that would be expected in that sort of role </p>
								<p> In order to become the best applicant for this position I would definitely need to finish my IT degree, taking as many programming subjects available throughout the duration of this course to develop my abilities and learn new things like Node.js and React.js. Hopefully by the end of this degree I am competent enough to get a job in the same field and get a chance to practically apply this knowledge and this practical application would definitely help me learn and grow my skills and ability to problem solve with these concepts and languages. I could even apply to this company as a Junior Team Member and be mentored by the type of person who would fill the job ad posted above!

								<h2 class="major">My Personal Profile</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/virtuoso.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								
									<p> 
									I did the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16 personalities test</a> and identified that I am a 'Virtuoso' Personality.
									I typically don't hold too much faith in these types of tests however I do recognise that I do possess about 50-60% of the traits outlined in the typing so its not entirely inaccurate. Virtuosos are labeled as curious and creative, exploring the world with their hands and learning as they go, Virtuosos are often engineers and mechanics and don't mind getting their hands dirty, they explore ideas through trial and error, preferring to learn things first hand and troubleshooting their way through problems.
									</p>
									<p> Additionally I did a <a href="https://www.how-to-study.com/learning-style-assessment/">Learning Style Assessment</a> and learnt that I am Tactile/Kinestheic learner. And I also did a <a href="http://www.testmycreativity.com/">Creativity Test</a> and got the results in the Graph Below. 
									<span class ="image main"><img src="images/creativity.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p> From these results from various tests I have deduced that I am curious and creative person, I am bold and persistent and I feel like these traits can be both a benefit and a drawback for conducive teamwork. The obvious benefits are that I am driven and a natural leader thanks to my curious and bold nature. However, the drawbacks are that In my boldness and persistence I can be stubborn and insensitive, it is important I keep these characteristics in mind when forming the team for our group project. As someone who tends to take charge and likes to get stuff done I feel like i'm going to take on a bunch of the delegation and I know I wont get on with the more laid-back and mellow personalities as I really like to get things done, I am definitely capable of adapting to any sort of team environment however I would prefer to choose group members that are driven and bold like myself. </p>

							<!-- Project Idea -->
							<article id="ProjectIdea">
								<h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>A great project idea that really demonstrates the sort of innovation I would like to see in the tech industry, is the cost and accessibility of prosthetics for those who cant really afford the standard prosthetic price tag. I believe that an Arduino, a #D printed hand and a few other parts would be a cost effective way of bringing prosthetics to people who need them.</p>
								<p>The thing about prosthetics is that they are expensive, costing hundreds to thousands of dollars to buy excluding any form of maintenance costs that may need to be dealt with after a bit of wear and tear. They are also so inaccessible for people in third world and war torn countries, there are over 1.5 million people in Syria living with permanent war related damage, over 86,000 of those people have lost limbs, and I bet most of them cant afford to get themselves an expensive prosthetic. The Arduino run and 3d printed prosthetic is a great solution as it is far cheaper to make than a standard prosthetic and hence would become more accessible and affordable for people like us here in Australia to donate prosthetics to these people who need them most.</p>
								<p> { Insert Description - 500 Words} </p>
								<p>The first thing you would need is a 3D Printed Arm, There are plenty of templates available on the internet or you can design your own using a program like SolidWorks to model it. Once you have your arm you will need an Arduino and a Motor Control Board, Wires, Servos and some fishing wire, You will also need tape or glue to secure the components and in the event that your 3D printer didn’t do a perfect job you may need a bit of sandpaper and some pliers to rip off the excess chunks and fix the appearance of the arm. The two most expensive components of these add up to about $35.00 together which is a huge difference in price when compared to how much a standard prosthetic would cost. </p>
								<p>Obviously there is an element of programming that comes with making a prosthetic arm move, however you don’t need to be an expert programmer, </p>
