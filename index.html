								<p>Hi, my name is Tia Comyns, my student number is s3797021 and my email is s3797021@student.rmit.edu.au </p>
								<p>A bit of background on me, I was born November 1997 in Hong Kong and I've lived in Australia now for a little over 16 years, I moved from Sydney to Melbourne 10 months ago and i'm really loving the city. 
I graduated from Cronulla High School in 2015 and took a few years between school and Uni to discover myself, do some working and some travelling and find out what I really wanted to do with my life. 
In my free time I enjoy playing video games, consuming sci-fi media in all its forms and I also have a very cool pok√©mon card collection that i'm pretty proud of.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My fascination with IT stemmed from my childhood, I was so interested in knowing how things worked that I would often take toys apart and try and reconstruct them, this developed in my teens into a passion for building PC's, I find assembling a computer very therapeutic. Something that was slightly less accessible but I was still quite curious about, was the software that goes into the computer, the brains behind the physical pieces of the computer that made everything work, I always understood the basic functionality and why but the code is what I find really fascinating. 
<p/>
<p>I chose to come to RMIT because a friend of mine recently graduated from RMIT and I've heard from many that the IT course here is one of the best, as well as knowing that RMIT has so many industry connections through former students and affiliated organisations. Its also a very unique university in the sense that it doesn't feel like </p>
								<p>During my Studies I hope to learn the ins and outs of IT. From the barebone construction of a website or piece of software to designing a user friendly interface and performing maintenance. I enjoy a challenge and I think that learning Programming is a great way to challenge myself every day and in the workplace. </p>

								<h2 class="major">My Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> The <a href=https://www.seek.com.au/job/38495425?type=standard&searchrequesttoken=8cd7ff84-369e-4625-8d1e-f5e605dbd42b> Job Ad</a> I chose is as a Fullstack Java Developer for DotDev posted by affix group. I've posted a screenshot of the gist of the job ad below. But its basically an opportunity to create Web Applications, Apps and even do some API Development which is something I find really interesting to implement and try out for myself. The successful applicant (hopefully me) would work with a close and talented team to create these pieces of software in the realm of Shopify products. You're also expected to update and improve on the software over time and implement new ideas and strategies of your own design, with focus on the products they provide rather than the ecommerce side of things. The role also includes the opportunity to work with big companies on their web platforms, with names like Bank of Melbourne and Shopify in their portfolio.</p>
								<p> The thing that most appeals to me about the role is the close knit team based environment they portray in the job ad, even just the written advertisement gives me a great feeling about the working environment, which is arguably one of the most important things about any job you will ever have.
									The role also allows for quite a lot of creativity and problem solving, both things that are very appealing to me as I love being creative and experimenting.
									The company also is located in South Yarra which is a huge plus for me as I hate driving ages to get to work and live close by, and also has a degree of flexibility with the working hours, which is something else thats pretty important to me as my life can get a bit hectic at times. The only other notable plus is they offer competitive salary packages with bonus and entitlements, whilst this is not outlined in detail in the advertisement its something I would be pretty excited for if I was actually applying for this role right now
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/jobad.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> The role requires lots of teamwork, strong Javascript skills, and preferably experience in areas like Serverless Architechure, Node.js and React.js, and amazing problem solving ability, there is also quite a bit of creative freedom in this role so the ability to be creative and identify what the client needs is essential. </p>
								<p> The position requires a lot more Java skill than I currently have, it also requires experience in stuff I've only ever heard of and never even put into practice like Serverless Architechure etc. However I definitely have the experience in working with a team with almost 7 years experience now working and managing staff in team environments. I am a very creative person and I love problem solving which are definitely big parts of this jobs however I don't believe my ability in either of these are currently up to the level that would be expected in that sort of role </p>
								<p> In order to become the best applicant for this position I would definitely need to finish my IT degree, taking as many programming subjects available throughout the duration of this course to develop my abilities and learn new things like Node.js and React.js. Hopefully by the end of this degree I am competent enough to get a job in the same field and get a chance to practically apply this knowledge and this practical application would definitely help me learn and grow my skills and ability to problem solve with these concepts and languages. I could even apply to this company as a Junior Team Member and be mentored by the type of person who would fill the job ad posted above!
